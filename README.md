# 👋 Hi, I'm Olivia Lynn

🔭 I'm a software developer with **LINCC Frameworks** at **Carnegie Mellon University**. We write code for everyone, but especially the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://rubinobservatory.org/)!

💡 My current work centers on building **collaborative large-scale infrastructure for astronomy**--mostly in Python, always open-source.

🛠️ Previously, I’ve built location- and gesture-based AR/VR software, museum-scale interactive exhibitions (including a touchscreen installation for the Teenie Harris Archive), IoT automation systems, and indie video games--using tools like Unity, openFrameworks, TensorFlow, and more.

📍 Based in **Pittsburgh, PA**; often in Seattle and New York (and always looking for an excuse to visit)!

## 🔬 Featured Projects:

- **🌐 [LSDB • astronomy-commons/lsdb](https://github.com/astronomy-commons/lsdb):** A scalable analysis framework designed for crossmatching and analyzing large astronomical datasets efficiently.

- **🌠 [TDAstro • lincc-frameworks/tdastro](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/tdastro):** A fast, modular Python library for simulating and analyzing variable sources in time-domain astronomy. I contribute to core API design and functionality, supporting its use in scientific pipelines and large-scale simulations.

- **🚂 [RAIL • LSSTDESC/rail ](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail):** A modular, extensible framework for photometric redshift estimation and uncertainty quantification in large-scale surveys. I've contributed to its architecture and integration within the LSST DESC ecosystem.

## 🌱 Currently Learning About:

- 📚 **Personal Knowledge Management Systems** and fine-tuning my new Obsidian set up. I've been working with a mix of Forte's Second Brain and Zettelkasten notes, and am always down to experiment with new systems. Hit me up with your own PKM thoughts and ideas!

- 🖥️ Reviewing **foundational systems architecture** knowledge. It's been years! Reach out if you'd like to form any level of informal book club around *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective* (or just reminisce about 15-213).

- 👨‍💻 **Sociological implications of the Internet.** At the time of writing this, I'm finally reading my copy of *Hooked*, and I'm also working on learning more about dead Internet theory. Let me know if you have any recommendatoins for materials on how people are incentivized to stay addicted to the Internet, how both algorithms and bot farms are designed to affect peoples' beliefs at a large scale, and anything related to these topics!
